    	<release version="1.1.2" date="2014-07-15" description="Add">
            <action dev="joseph" type="add">
            Added BiportalService class which uses a json response from bioprtal service.

    <release version="1.1.0" date="2014-01-28"
        description="Using v4.0 of BioPortal web services">
        <action dev="rafalcan" type="add">
            Added field classUri to BioportalOntology enumeration, to use it
            with the v4.0 of BioPortal web services. The existing field id
            (meaning the ontology ID in BioPortal) is now deprecated, as it is
            not used in v4.0.

    </release>
	<release version="1.0.3" date="2013-03-06"
        description="Disease search also in OMIM and MeSH">
		<action dev="rafalcan" type="fix">
            Searches of diseases are now performed not only against EFO but
            also against OMIM and MeSH. The old method
            (BioportalWsAdapter.getDiseaseByName) is now deprecated, also
            because its name was misleading (can search by ID too).
            <fixes issue="147"/>
        </action>
        <action dev="rafalcan" type="fix">
            Introduced workaround to ignore obsolete EFO entries, which have
            been deprecated in favour of orphanet entries.
        </action>
        <action dev="rafalcan" type="update">
			Updated to latest version of parent pom file (move to GitHub),
			ep-domain, biobabel-core and junit.
		</action>
        <action dev="rafalcan" type="add">
            Added MeSH to the enumeration of BioPortal ontologies.
