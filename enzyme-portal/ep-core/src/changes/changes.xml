             description="Enzyme comparison and chemical structure search">
            <action dev="joseph" type="add">
                Added methods for browse disease and enzyme classifications.
            </action>
            <action dev="rafalcan" type="add">
                Added package to compare two enzymes side by side.
            </action>
            <action dev="rafalcan" type="update">
                Updated to latest version of ep-domain - which adds equals and
                hashCode methods to the JAXB-generated classes -, intenz-adapter,
                rhea-adapter, chebi-adapter and mega-mapper.
            </action>
            <action dev="rafalcan" type="fix">
                The number of compounds added to the enzyme model is not limited by
                the searchConfig any more. We need this for enzyme comparisons, and
                for the future downloads. The view of compounds in the small
                molecules tab will not be affected, as the configuration is used
                there.
            </action>
            <action dev="rafalcan" type="add">
                Added configuration for maximum text length shown for a field.
            </action>
            <action dev="rafalcan" type="add">
                Added method EnzymeFinder.getEnzymesByCompound to retrieve enzymes
                related to a given ChEBI ID (for the structure search).
            </action>
            <action dev="rafalcan" type="fix">
                CompoundsPredicate uses the compound ID again - not the name - to
                evaluate, which fixes a problem with spring parameter handling and
                commas in compound names.

            <action dev="rafalcan" type="update" issue="182">
                Updated to latest version of ebeye-adapter, which fixes domain name

                and rhea-ws-client.
            </action>
            <action dev="rafalcan" type="remove">
                Deprecated use of config.xml from ep-domain to read EB-Eye domains
                (now using the Domains enumeration in ebeye-adapter).
            </action>
            <action dev="rafalcan" type="remove">

                Fixed issue with leaking connections: the EnzymeFinder constructor
