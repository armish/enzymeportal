    <release version="1.0.22" date="" description="New parser for ChEMBL xrefs">
        <action dev="rafalcan" type="add">
            Added class ChemblSaxParser, which deprecates EbeyeSaxParser (it was
            only used for ChEMBL xrefs). This new class processes the ebinocle
            file chembl-target_component.xml instead of chembl-target.xml, due
            to changes in the content of it.

    <release version="1.0.21" date="2013-11-25"
        description="Recovered missing diseases.">
        <action dev="rafalcan" type="fix" issue="195">
            Now OMIM cross-references are not (unfairly) discarded because of a
            low score in the UniMed file.
        </action>
        <action dev="rafalcan" type="update">
            Updated to latest versions of ep-util, biobabel-core and
            chembl-adapter.

        description="ChEMBL bioactivities">
        <action dev="rafalcan" type="fix" issue="75">
            Modified EbeyeSaxParser in order to use chembl-adapter to filter
            ChEMBL compounds by criteria defined in a properties file. This
            will reduce the huge number of compounds coming from ChEMBL, keeping
            only those which have special interest and specificity.

    <release version="1.0.18" date="2013-08-20"
        description="Cross-references ChEBI-EP">
        <action dev="rafalcan" type="add">
            Added script to provide a XML for ChEBI to generate their
            cross-references to the Enzyme Portal. This is a requirement for
            the compound structure search in EP.
        </action>
        <action dev="rafalcan" type="update">
            Updated to latest versions of ep-util - with improved parsing of

            Compounds retrieved with roles.">
        <action dev="rafalcan" type="add">
            Added application to retrieve cross-references from IntEnzXML:
            EC-reactions, EC-substrates/products, EC-cofactors,
            Rhea-reactants/products. This replaces the import from ChEBI
            (cofactors and catalytic activity) which was a bit fuzzy due to
            text mining.
        </action>
        <action dev="rafalcan" type="add">
            Added concrete relationships "is_substrate_of" and "is_product_of"

        </action>
        <action dev="rafalcan" type="fix">
            Fixed import of ChEMBL cross references. There were some extra - and
            wrong - due to a bug in EbeyeSaxParser.
            <fixes issue="168"/>
        </action>
        <action dev="rafalcan" type="update">
            Updated to latest version of ep-util - which provides extraction of
            inhibitors and activators from UniProt - and ep-domain - which
            provides roles for compounds.
