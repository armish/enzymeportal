    <release version="1.0.16" date="2013-05-03"
        description="Cross-references for small molecules taken from IntEnz">
        <action dev="rafalcan" type="add">
            Added concrete relationships "is_substrate_of" and "is_product_of"
            for ChEBI-EC cross-references.
        </action>
        <action dev="rafalcan" type="add">
            Added application to retrieve cross-references from IntEnzXML:
            EC-reactions, EC-substrates/products, EC-cofactors,
            Rhea-reactants/products. This replaces the import from ChEBI
            (cofactors and catalytic activity) which was a bit fuzzy due to
            text mining.
