comment on table uniprot2compound is
'Created from MM_ENTRY, MM_ACCESSION and MM_XREF for quick retrieval of
compounds related to a UniProt entry.';

comment on column uniprot2compound.uniprot_accession is
'The UniProt accession is the primary one.';

comment on column uniprot2compound.compound_db is
'Cross references from ChEBI are either direct (inhibitors/activators) or
inferred from the EC classification (cofactors, reaction participants in
Rhea). Other databases - DrugBank, ChEMBL - are cross referenced with no
intermediate step.';
