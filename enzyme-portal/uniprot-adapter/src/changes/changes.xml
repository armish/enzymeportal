    <release version="1.0.4" date=""
        description="Using ep-util to mine enzyme regulation text for inhibitors
        and activators.">
        <action dev="rafalcan" type="update">
            Updated to latest versions of ep-util, ep-domain and mega-mapper.
        </action>
        <action dev="rafalcan" type="fix">
            Using ep-util to text-mine UniProt for activators and inhibitors,
            with proper regular expressions. The old methods here are now
            deprecated and point to ep-util actually.
        </action>
        <action dev="rafalcan" type="remove">
            Removed tests from Transformer, as the methods parsing text for
            inhibitors/activators have moved to EPUtil.
        </action>
    </release>
    <release version="1.0.3" date="2013-04-08" description="Bug fix">
        <action dev="rafalcan" type="fix">
            Closing mega-mapper after using it avoids more than likely problems
            (too many open cursors).
        </action>
    </release>
	<release version="1.0.2" date="2013-04-05" description="Bug fix">
	    <action dev="rafalcan" type="fix">
	        Now this module uses mega-mapper (added dependency) to retrieve
	        PDB xrefs from there and replace the ones coming from UniProt, which
	        include theoretical models. The previous solution was buggy, as it
	        retrieved PDB xrefs for all of the orthologs, mixing them and
	        resulting sometimes in the wrong thumbnail being displayed.
            <fixes issue="146"/>
	    </action>
		<action dev="rafalcan" type="update">
			Updated to latest version of parent pom file (move to GitHub),
			ep-domain, ep-util, uniprotjapi - to use always the latest release -
			and junit.
		</action>

	<release version="1.0.1" date="2012-05-21"/>
